# Correlation Analysis
#
Dear Students,

Use "tips" dataset from seaborn library
Use EDA lecture notes to analyse the dataset. And visualize the dataset. 
      EDA- 1-  use all the functions given below 
                    shape, head, dtypes, isnull, describe, info
               2- Analysis of Categorical/ Numerical Variables
               3- Analysis of Correlation
Make hypothesis and check your hypothesis. Make probability control by using Shapiro. 
Compute correlation coefficient for "total_bill" column.
Make correlation reliability test (use pearsonr module)
Write a short discussion about outputs.

Good luck :)
